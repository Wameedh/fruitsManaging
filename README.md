To-do style app for managing fruits


Create a to-do style app for managing fruits. Users will be able to add new records (fruit type + quantity) to the list, edit or delete existing records, and clear all records. Duplicates of the same type of 3 are not allowed. As a stretch goal, add an import button that will allow users to upload records from a csv file.
